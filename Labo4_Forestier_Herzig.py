# Labo 4 from VTK.
#
# Goal: The goal of this laboratory is to visualize the path of a glider taking off 
#       from the frozen lake of Ottsj√∂n in Sweden. The flight of this glider will also
#       allow us to visualize the ascending and descending airflows under the influence 
#       of the surrounding mountain relief.
